# BLE Capstone Project Authentication Server

### Introduction
This is the authentication server for our capstone project. Very early speculative development.

### Status
Absolutely nothing runs. First step is to get the cryptographic stuff working.

### Technical Details
The server uses Ruby and MySQL. Maybe it'll use Rails too. Not an expert in this area.
